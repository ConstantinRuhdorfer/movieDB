# movieDB

This project was orginially part of the my Introduction to OO in Java but now serves as a way for me too work on recommendation system ideas in scala.

## Original readme
Project of the Java class at DHBW Stuttgart in the summer semester of 2018.

This project reads in a file which contains all kinds of information about around 10k movies, parses it and can give recommendations to a user based on their preferences.
You can tell the project about your preferences by using the command line tool that the program comes with.
